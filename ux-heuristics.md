# UX Heuristics

Our heuristics are practical guidelines we use to evaluate and improve our work. They're built on Nielsen Norman Group's 10 usability heuristics and adapted for Hudl's unique voice, users, and product goals. These heuristics give us a shared language for discussing quality, and they should be used in every design critique, review, and decision to help us consistently raise the bar across all Hudl experiences.

## How to Evaluate Using These Heuristics

When asked to evaluate a project, design, or implementation against these heuristics:

1. **Review each heuristic systematically** - Go through all 9 heuristics in order
2. **Use the critique questions** - Apply the specific questions listed under each heuristic to the work being evaluated
3. **Provide specific examples** - Reference specific UI elements, flows, or code implementations when identifying issues or strengths
4. **Organize feedback by heuristic** - Structure your evaluation with clear sections for each heuristic (e.g., "### They Make the Call")
5. **Be actionable** - When identifying issues, suggest concrete improvements aligned with Hudl's user base (directors, coaches, athletes and parents)
6. **Consider severity** - Note whether issues are critical (block user goals), moderate (cause friction), or minor (polish opportunities)
7. **Highlight what works well** - Call out examples where the work excels against a heuristic
8. **Think like a coach or athlete** - Remember the audience: confident decision-makers who value clarity, speed, and control

When referencing these heuristics in evaluation, use the heuristic names (e.g., "They Make the Call", "Consistency Wins") to maintain consistency with Hudl's voice.


## They Make the Call

**NN/g: User control and freedom**

Users should feel in control at every step. Coaches and athletes are confident decision-makers—Hudl should enable, not restrict them.

### Critique Questions to ask

* Can users undo/reverse actions easily?
* Are back paths and exits obvious?
* Are we giving them a chance to confirm when they're about to make a big move?
* Do they feel confident exploring without fear of messing up their work?


## Consistency Wins

**NN/g: Consistency and standards**

Predictability builds trust. Consistency across language, patterns, and systems keeps Hudl feeling like one product and helps users build muscle memory.

### Critique questions to ask

* Are we following Uniform patterns?
* Is terminology/content consistent?
* Do similar features behave the same way across the whole platform?
* Are platform & standards (Mac, mobile, web) respected?


## Make It Obvious

**NN/g: Recognition rather than recall**

Don't force users to remember—surface the right info and actions at the right time. Confidence comes from clarity.

### Critique questions to ask

* Are the key actions right where they need them?
* Are hidden options avoided?
* Are icons supported by labels/tooltips?
* Are we reinforcing patterns they already know from the world of sports?


## Make It Feel Familiar

**NN/g: Match between system and the real world**

Design should reflect how users already think and talk. When interfaces feel familiar, coaches and athletes move faster and use Hudl with confidence.

### Critique questions to ask

* Are we using the terms they use on a regular basis?
* Do flows reflect how users naturally approach this experience?
* Are we avoiding internal lingo they would never hear from a fellow coach or analyst?
* Does the experience behave the way they'd expect it to?


## Only What Matters

**NN/g: Aesthetic and minimalist design**

Every element should earn its place. Clean, focused design saves time and keeps attention on what's important.

### Critique questions to ask

* Are we showing only what's needed?
* Is layout clean and focused?
* Is hierarchy highlighting what's important?
* Are we getting straight to the point without over-explaining?


## Keep Them in the Loop

**NN/g: Visibility of system status**

Users should always understand what's happening—whether uploading video, syncing data, or navigating tasks. Clear, timely feedback builds trust and keeps users moving without guesswork.

### Critique questions to ask

* Is the system's current state clear and visible (but out of the way)?
* Are status updates timely and in the flow of work?
* Are we talking to them like a coach would, not like a dev team?
* Are animations/indicators helping (not distracting)?
* Does the feedback feel like a sideline conversation, not a random alert?


## Make It Hard to Mess Up

**NN/g: Error prevention**

Anticipate mistakes and design guardrails that prevent them. Errors cost users time and trust—every call to support should be treated as a defect.

### Critique questions to ask

* Are risky actions clearly labeled/confirmed?
* Are fields/forms validated in real time?
* Are smart defaults reducing setup errors?
* Is it obvious what each action will do?
* Are we ensuring the user has undo/redo actions where possible?


## Design for Confidence

**NN/g: Help and documentation**

Users should never feel stuck. Contextual help and guidance build confidence, teach along the way, and make complex workflows approachable.

### Critique questions to ask

* Is guidance embedded (onboarding, tooltips, empty states)?
* Are users supported without leaving their flow?
* Is help practical and easy to find?
* Are new features introduced in a confidence-building way?


## Help Them Bounce Back

**NN/g: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**

Errors happen. Clear, supportive recovery keeps trust and momentum intact.

### Critique questions to ask

* Are errors written in plain, helpful language?
* Is recovery clear and easy to find?
* Are vague errors ("Something went wrong") avoided?
* Are critical issues styled/placed so they can't be missed?
